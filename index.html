					<h2>Malai Kofta</h2>
						<p>
							Malai translates to cream and kofta to fried balls. So malai kofta literally translates to koftas dunked in creamy sauce or gravy. Malai Kofta (vegetable "meatballs" in a thick sauce) is the vegetarian alternative to meatballs. The koftas are made with a mix of potatoes, carrots, beans, peas, and sweet corn, which are cooked and mashed before mixing with spices and cheese that essential blocked "cheese" that is similar to tofu in texture and a great addition to any vegetarian meal. It's rather easy to find if you don't want to make it, especially if you shop at a natural foods market.
