      Malai Kofta
    </div>
    <p>
      Malai translates to cream and kofta to fried balls. So malai kofta literally translates to koftas dunked in creamy sauce or gravy. Malai Kofta (vegetable "meatballs" in a thick sauce) is the vegetarian alternative to meatballs. The koftas are made with a mix of potatoes, carrots, beans, peas, and sweet corn, which are cooked and mashed before mixing with spices and cheese that essential blocked "cheese" that is similar to tofu in texture and a great addition to any vegetarian meal. It's rather easy to find if you don't want to make it, especially if you shop at a natural foods market. REPEATING THE TEXT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO WRITE ABOUT THIS AND IT LOOKS REALLY SMALL ON DESKTOP VERSION OF THE WEBSITE. lol . Malai translates to cream and kofta to fried balls.

      Naan
    </div>
    <p>
      Naan, a puffy flatbread, is a staple in the Indian kitchen and can go with everything you make, including many popular dishes like Chole and Shahi Paneer etc. Though Naan(Leavened Indian flatread) is traditionally cooked in a tandoor or earthen oven, they work just as well in your own oven. The ingredient list includes yeast, flour, sugar, and water, as well as yogurt and ghee. Another well-known kind of flatbread is Chapati(Tortillas).Originally, nan was a general term for various flatbreads from different parts of the world. The name stems from Persian, itself from Sanskrit nayan; being a generic word for bread.
